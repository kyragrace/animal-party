Once upon a time in Motueka, some humans threw a party for animals. First to arrive was Merrin's cat, Jack, who she brought from Wellington. He found someone to cuddle him.

Joy the Unicorn popped in for a visit. She started off the day full of enthusiasm and feeling like she could take on the world. By 3pm she wasn't quite floating on air like before....

She then wondered if her attempt at inserting an image worked. Joy the Unicorn is getting a headache now :-)

Tenzing the Yak climbed to get the famed mountain chocolate from the Buddhist monks at the top of the Himalayan Ranges.
When the monks found that he was bringing the special chocolate to the Rails Girls in Motueka, they packed his bags fully!
